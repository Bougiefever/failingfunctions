## Failing Functions
This project provised some examples of "stepping off the happy path" when building Azure Functions. 

There are many examples out there, but most assume that everything will work perfectly every time. In this repository you will find examples of adding resiliency to your functions so that when errors occur, you can handle them gracefully.
